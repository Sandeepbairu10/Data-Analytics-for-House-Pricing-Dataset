# Data-Analytics-for-House-Pricing-Dataset
Analyzed House Sales dataset (USA) to uncover factors influencing housing prices.

Performed data cleaning and wrangling (handling missing values, formatting, feature selection) using Pandas & NumPy.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to identify correlations between house price and variables like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

Built and compared machine learning models (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression) to predict house prices.

Evaluated model performance using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE), improving accuracy with feature engineering and model refinement.

Delivered insights into key drivers of housing prices for better market understanding.
